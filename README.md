RNA-CHAMP is a protein-RNA interaction profiling platform based on a previously described CHAMP.
Image align pipeline were identical to CHAMP and is available at https://github.com/finkelsteinlab/CHAMP.

Target 1 & 2 were used in the PFS library. All PFS library has three randomized nucleotides on both ends of the target.

Target 1 & 3 were used to generate partailly matched library (mismatches, insertions, and deletions).
